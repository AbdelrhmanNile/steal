# About

This is the scrapper used to scrape johncena141 profile on 1337x for games, fetch cover arts for the games from igdb, push the games to mongo db <br />

YOU ONLY NEED THIS IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN DATABASE FOR STEAL

# Dependecies
install the the imports by using pip, too lazy to list them :P

# Usage
1- setup your own mongodb and replace the link on line 38 at steal_scrapper.py with your own mongodb link [do not hard code the password] <br />

2- setup your own [igdb api](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about)

3- on main.py:

- put all the credentials required
- run the script and it will do all the work
